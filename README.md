## üìë Course Content

This course uses a project-based learning approach towards the study of online publishing and group-based collaboration, essential ingredients of modern data science projects.

It introduces the principles and applications of the electronic storage, structuring, manipulation, transformation, extraction, and dissemination of data. This includes data types, how data is stored and recorded electronically, the concept and fundamentals of databases. It also covers how data is formatted and communicated. It presents basic methods for obtaining data from the Internet, including simple methods for web scraping and the use of APIs to submit queries that return structured data. Finally, it covers methods for formatting and publishing data.

Sharing and publishing data will also form a key part of this module and will include key skills in on-line publishing, including the elements of web design, the technical elements of web technologies and web programming, as well as the use of revision-control and group collaboration tools such as GitHub. Each student will build an interactive website based on content relevant to their domain-related interests, and will use GitHub for accessing and submitting course materials and assignments. The final project will involve group work to create a data-based website published on GitHub.

This module is not designed to be a hands-on introduction to the use of databases, but does introduce the concepts of databases. For more detailed learning on databases, we will encourage students to take ST207 Databases.

### üìù Learning Objectives

(From CAPIS)

By the end of this course students will be able to:
- Understand the basic structure of data types and common data formats
- Show familiarity with international standards for common data types
- Manage a typical data acquisition, cleaning, structuring, and analysis workflow using practical examples
- Clean data, and diagnose common problems involved in data corruption and how to fix them
- Understand the concept and fundamentals of databases
- Link data is linked from different sources
- Manage a typical data acquisition, cleaning, structuring, and analysis workflow using practical examples and real database applications.
- Use the collaboration and version control system GitHub, based on the git version control system.
- Understand the fundamentals of ‚Äúmarkup‚Äù languages, including Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible
- Markup Language (XML), and the Markdown format for formatting documents and web pages.
- Create and maintain simple websites using HTML and CSS
