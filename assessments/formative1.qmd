## Formative assignment

This problem set is not graded but you will get written feedback if you submit. 

Check out the [üîñ Week 02 Appendix - üìÉ Text editors](/weeks/week02/appendix.qmd#text-editors) section for more info on `vim`.

Follow the steps below and, when asked, copy your responses to the [Moodle page of this assignment](https://moodle.lse.ac.uk/mod/coursework/view.php?id=1123148&forceview=1).

    ```bash
     whoami

2. Take a screenshot ([how?](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/)) of your terminal and submit to Moodle, under the field identified as P1.

### P2: Edit a file

1. Go to the DS105 folder you created earlier during [W02 lab](/weeks/week02/lab.qmd):

    ```bash
     cd ~/DS105
    ```

2. Rename the `README.txt` to `README.md` (a markdown file):

    ```bash
     mv README.txt README.md
    ```

3. Edit the README.md file following the template below, replacing all occurrences of `<>` with your responses:

    ```markdown
    # DS105

    Name: <>
    Date: <>
    Candidate Number: <>
    Degree Program: <>

4. Save and quit vim.

5. Print some metadata about your file to prove you were the one editing it:

    ```bash
     stat README.md
    ```

6. Print the contents of your file to the terminal:

    ```bash
     cat README.md
    ```

7. Take a screenshot ([how?](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/)) of your terminal and submit to Moodle, under the field identified as P2. Make sure that both the output of `stat` and `cat` commands are visible.
