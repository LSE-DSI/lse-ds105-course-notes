## Definitions (cont.) {.smaller}

That is:

::: incremental
- An organisation does not need to build and **maintain** an infrastructure of computer servers
    - **maintain** is truly a key word here
    - You need specialised workforce to mitigate problems and keep services up
    - ü§î Think about it: 
        - what if a CPU fails? 
        - hat if a hard drive becomes corrupted? 
        - how often should you backup data? where should you keep it?
- Instead, CPU processing, data storage and access is <mark>delegated</mark> to a set of computers _somewhere else_
- Users, and organisations, only pay for what they use.

# What is in the cloud?


## Google Cloud services

![](/figures/week03/gcloud_services.png){width="100%"}

::: {.aside}
Let me walk you through what you can find on GCloud: [GCloud Cheat Sheet](https://googlecloudcheatsheet.withgoogle.com/) ‚è≠Ô∏è
:::

::: notes
- Let's see what is in Google Cloud
- Click on each area to see what the services offer
:::

## What about AWS?

![](/figures/week03/aws_services.png){width="100%"}

::: {.aside}
Let me walk you through what you can find on AWS: [AWS Cloud Products](https://aws.amazon.com/products) ‚è≠Ô∏è
:::

::: notes
- Let's see what is in Google Cloud
- Click on each area to see what the services offer
:::

## Azure services

![](/figures/week03/azure_services.png){width="100%"}

::: {.aside}
Here is the link to the relevant page of [Azure Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/).
:::

::: notes
- You can browse by yourself
:::

## Cloud computing models

We can think of these services in the following categories:

- **Software as a Service** (SaaS)
- **Infrastructure as a Service** (IaaS)
- **Platform as a Service** (PaaS)

Let's go through each one of those.

# Software as a Service (SaaS)

## SaaS {.smaller}


- Software that you interact with but runs elsewhere, not in your machine.
- To name a few examples:

::: columns

::: {.column width="45%"}
::: incremental
- **File storage:** 
  - Dropbox
  - Google Drive
  - One Drive
  - Sharepoint
:::

:::

::: {.column style="width:45%margin-left:5%"}
::: incremental
- **Web apps:** 
  - Google Suite
  - Google Docs
  - Outlook Web
  - Office 365
  - Moodle
:::
:::

# Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

## IaaS {.smaller}

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: incremental
- Direct access to <mark>virtual machines</mark> and <mark>data storage</mark>.
- Instead of buying computers for yourself/your organisation, you rent it.
  - You do not pay, or you pay very little, when your cloud machines are off.
- Use cases: web site hosting, Big Data analysis, run simulations.
- Complete flexibility: you install and run whatever you want in those computers. 
  - Terms & Conditions apply, obviously.

  - EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud)*
  - S3  (Amazon Simple Storage Service)

- **Google Cloud**
  - Compute
  - Storage

- **Azure**
  - Compute
  - Storage
  - Windows Server
  - Linux on Azure

- Create Google Cloud Compute, run and access.
- If time allows, do the same with AWS EC2
