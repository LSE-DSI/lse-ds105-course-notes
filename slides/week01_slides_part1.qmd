# Learning Objectives

<!-- FROM CAPIS:
By the end of this course students will be able to:
- Understand the basic structure of data types and common data formats
- Show familiarity with international standards for common data types
- Manage a typical data acquisition, cleaning, structuring, and analysis workflow using practical examples
- Clean data, and diagnose common problems involved in data corruption and how to fix them
- Understand the concept and fundamentals of databases
- Link data is linked from different sources
- Manage a typical data acquisition, cleaning, structuring, and analysis workflow using practical examples and real database applications.
- Use the collaboration and version control system GitHub, based on the git version control system.
- Understand the fundamentals of “markup” languages, including Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible
- Markup Language (XML), and the Markdown format for formatting documents and web pages.
- Create and maintain simple websites using HTML and CSS
- Use APIs to send and retrieve data from Internet sources -->

This course will cover the fundamentals of data, with an aim to understanding:

::: incremental
- how data is **generated**, 
- how it is **collected**, 
- how it must be **transformed** for use and storage
- how it is **stored**, and 
- the ways it can be **retrieved** and **communicated**. 
:::


## Learning Objectives (cont.)

The course will also cover:

::: incremental
- **workflow management** of individual and collaborative data science project 
- setup and tools for typical **data pre-processing** (data transformation and data cleaning)
    - frequently the starting point and most time-consuming part of any data science project.

## Structure of lectures 👨🏻‍:school:

Our lectures will be split in two parts:

::: incremental
-   Part I (\~ 50 min): Traditional exposition of theoretical content
-   break (\~ 10 min): Grab coffee :coffee: or relax :lotus_position:
-   Part II (\~ 50 min): Live demo
    -   Typically, demonstration of terminal usage or Jupyter notebooks
    -   Feel free to follow along in your own laptops.
:::

## Structure of classes :woman_technologist:

::: incremental
-   Students will work on weekly, structured problem sets in the staff-led class sessions.
-   Tips to get the most of classes:
    -   Bring your own laptops :computer: (most tablets are not suitable for programming)
    -   Read the recommended reading prior to the class
    -   Attempt to replicate the examples demonstrated in the live demo during the lecture
:::

## Class groups

<mark class="todo"> Update the groups here once we hear back from LSE Timetables</mark>

## Assessments :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

The breakdown of assessment for this course will be as follows:

## Assessments - Problem sets (25%)

::: incremental
-   These will involve a mix of coding tasks and elements of self-assessment (similar to problem sets we will solve in the labs)
-   You will have until the day before the following class to submit your response
-   Summative problem sets will be released on: 
    - **Week 03** - worth 10% of final mark
    - **Week 04** - worth 15% of final mark
:::

## Assessments - Group presentations (35%)

::: incremental
-   You will form groups prior to Reading Week
    - Pitch your ideas of API/datasets on Week 04
    - Form the groups on Week 05
-   Group presentations: 
    - **Week 08** - worth 15% of final mark
    - **Week 11** - worth 20% of final mark
:::

## Assessments - Final project (40%)

::: incremental
- Each group will produce a webpage of their project
- Description of data, research questions, challenges, statistics and simple plots
- Think of it as a portfolio project!
- Submission deadline: Lent Term
    - Exact date to be confirmed
    - (end of Jan/2023 - beginning of Feb/2023)
:::

## Office hours

::: incremental
-   It is probably a good idea to book office hours if:
    -   you struggled with a technical or theoretical aspect of a problem set in the previous week,
    -   you have queries about careers in data science,
    -   you want guidance in how to apply data science to other things you are studying outside this course.
-   Come prepared. You only have 15 minutes.
-   Ask for help sooner rather than later.
-   Book slots via StudentHub up to 12 hours in advance.
:::

## Communication

::: incremental
-   Join our Slack group: <mark class="todo"> add link to slack</mark>
-   Use the public Slack channels to talk to share links, content (or *memes*) with your colleagues.
-   Our teaching team will dedicate some time during the week to answer questions or other interactions on Slack.
-   Reserve :email: e-mail for **formal requests**: extensions, deferrals, etc.
    -   No need to e-mail to inform you will skip a class, for example.

# How did we get here? 

::: notes
- and how did we get to the point that we can collect, extract and analyse all of this data?
- Well, this abundance of data is strongly associated with the dramatic changes in technology we have experienced recently.
- Take a look of the technology people were using back in 2005. 
- This photo was taken outside St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican at the time Ratzinger was ordained as pope
- Now, fast forward to 2013 — only 8 years later — when Pope Francis was elected the new pope, and you will see a lot of bright screens. 
- Our habits have changed
