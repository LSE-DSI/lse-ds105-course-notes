:::


## Learning Objectives (cont.)

The course will also cover:

::: incremental
- **workflow management** of individual and collaborative data science project 
- setup and tools for typical **data pre-processing** (data transformation and data cleaning)
    - frequently the starting point and most time-consuming part of any data science project.

## Structure of lectures üë®üèª‚Äç:school:

Our lectures will be split in two parts:

::: incremental
-   Part I (\~ 50 min): Traditional exposition of theoretical content
-   break (\~ 10 min): Grab coffee :coffee: or relax :lotus_position:
-   Part II (\~ 50 min): Live demo
    -   Typically, demonstration of terminal usage or Jupyter notebooks
    -   Feel free to follow along in your own laptops.
:::

## Structure of classes :woman_technologist:

::: incremental
-   Students will work on weekly, structured problem sets in the staff-led class sessions.
-   Tips to get the most of classes:
    -   Bring your own laptops :computer: (most tablets are not suitable for programming)
    -   Read the recommended reading prior to the class
    -   Attempt to replicate the examples demonstrated in the live demo during the lecture
:::

## Class groups

<mark class="todo"> Update the groups here once we hear back from LSE Timetables</mark>

## Assessments :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

The breakdown of assessment for this course will be as follows:

## Assessments - Problem sets (25%)

::: incremental
-   These will involve a mix of coding tasks and elements of self-assessment (similar to problem sets we will solve in the labs)
-   You will have until the day before the following class to submit your response
-   Summative problem sets will be released on: 
    - **Week 03** - worth 10% of final mark
    - **Week 04** - worth 15% of final mark
:::

## Assessments - Group presentations (35%)

::: incremental
-   You will form groups prior to Reading Week
    - Pitch your ideas of API/datasets on Week 04
    - Form the groups on Week 05
-   Group presentations: 
    - **Week 08** - worth 15% of final mark
    - **Week 11** - worth 20% of final mark
:::

## Office hours

::: incremental
-   It is probably a good idea to book office hours if:
    -   you struggled with a technical or theoretical aspect of a problem set in the previous week,
    -   you have queries about careers in data science,
    -   you want guidance in how to apply data science to other things you are studying outside this course.
-   Come prepared. You only have 15 minutes.
-   Ask for help sooner rather than later.
-   Book slots via StudentHub up to 12 hours in advance.
:::

## Communication

::: incremental
-   Join our Slack group: <mark class="todo"> add link to slack</mark>
-   Use the public Slack channels to talk to share links, content (or *memes*) with your colleagues.
-   Our teaching team will dedicate some time during the week to answer questions or other interactions on Slack.
-   Reserve :email: e-mail for **formal requests**: extensions, deferrals, etc.
    -   No need to e-mail to inform you will skip a class, for example.

# What do we mean by data science?

<!-- ## Data science is...

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
> *"\[...\] a field of study and practice that involves the **collection**, **storage**, and **processing** of data in order to derive important üí° **insights** into a problem or a phenomenon.*
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
> *Such data may be generated by **humans** (surveys, logs, etc.) or **machines** (weather data, road vision, etc.), and could be in **different formats** (text, audio, video, augmented or virtual reality, etc.)."*

## Data Science and Social Science

::: notes

:::

::: incremental
-   Social science: The goal is typically **explanation**
-   Data science: The goal is frequently **prediction**, or data exploration
-   Many of the same methods are used for both objectives
:::

<mark class="todo"> Illustrate </mark>

## Practical examples

::: aside
<mark class="todo"> Give a pratical example of how one would approach the same dataset differently under these two modelling views. </mark>

## What do I need to know (Statistics)

Basic concepts of Statistics you might want to recap [^1]:

[^1]: A good reference is [@warne_statistics_2018, chapters 1-3,5,6,11-12]

::: incremental
-   Expected value, mean, median, variance, standard deviation
-   Probabilities and simple probability distributions
-   Types of data
    -   discrete vs continuous
    -   categorical vs numerical vs ordinal
:::

## What do I need to know (`R`)

Basic concepts of programming in `R` to recap:

::: incremental
-   data structures (vectors, matrices, data frames)
-   how to manipulate data (filter, subset, select)
-   read/write data files (for example: CSV, JSON, TXT)
-   *(optional but encouraged)* some knowledge [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/)* can give you a productive boost

[^3]: *"Statistical inference via data science"* [@ismay_statistical_2020, chapters 4-6] is another great free resource

## What if I struggle with R?

‚û°Ô∏è Our first lab (Week 02) is a recap of some basic `R` commands, plus some ggplot2.

::: incremental
- If you are not confident with your `R` skills, I strongly encourage you invest in studying the basics in the next couple of weeks. 
- Contact [LSE Digital Skills Lab](https://info.lse.ac.uk/current-students/digital-skills-lab) to attend in-person workshops or self-paced online R courses.

## Philosophy of this course

::: incremental
-   It is important to understand the ideas behind the various techniques, in order to know how and when to use them.
-   One has to understand the simpler methods first, in order to grasp the more sophisticated ones.
-   It is important to accurately assess the performance of a method, to know how well or how badly it is working (simpler methods often perform as well as fancier ones!).

## Philosophy of this course (cont.)

::: incremental
-   This is an exciting research area, having important applications in science, industry and policy.
-   Machine learning is a fundamental ingredient in the training of a modern **data scientist**.
