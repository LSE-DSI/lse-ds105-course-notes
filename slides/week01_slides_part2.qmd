# What do we mean by data science?

## Data science is...

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
> *"\[...\] a field of study and practice that involves the **collection**, **storage**, and **processing** of data in order to derive important üí° **insights** into a problem or a phenomenon.*
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
> *Such data may be generated by **humans** (surveys, logs, etc.) or **machines** (weather data, road vision, etc.),*
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
> *and could be in **different formats** (text, audio, video, augmented or virtual reality, etc.)."*

## The reality: we are all jugglers :juggling_person:

-   <mark class="todo"> Data Scientists do not need know **everything**, only a **bit** of everything</mark> :juggling_person:

# How is that different to what I have learned in my previous stats courses?

## Data Science and Social Science

::: incremental
-   Social science: The goal is typically **explanation**
-   Data science: The goal is frequently **prediction**, or data exploration
-   Many of the same methods are used for both objectives

## Practical examples

::: aside
<mark class="todo"> Give a pratical example of how one would approach the same dataset differently under these two modelling views. </mark>
