<!-- ::: {.incremental} -->
- A computer can be divided in four parts:
  - <mark>hardware</mark> ‚Äî provides the basic computing resources for the system
  - <mark>application programs</mark> ‚Äî define the ways in which these resources are used
  - <mark>operating system</mark> ‚Äî controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for the various users
  - <mark>user</mark> ‚Äî a person or a bot (a computer script) that requests actions from the computer.

## Insight into operating systems {.smaller}
<br/>
<blockquote> _"An operating system is similar to a government. Like a government, it performs no useful function by itself. It simply provides an _environment_ within which other programs can do userful work."_ </blockquote>

- If this sounds a bit vague to you, it is because it is!
- It is difficult to specify which programs are part of the OS and which ones are not.
- Let's try to define what an OS is anyways ‚è≠Ô∏è 
<!-- ::: -->

## Definition of OS {.smaller}

<!-- ::: incremental -->
- "_The OS is the one programming running at all times on the computer_"
  - This is usually also called the <mark>kernel</mark>
- There are also other type of programs who might be running alongside. 
  - For example, the ![](/figures/icons/console-svgrepo-com.svg){style="height: 1em;vertical-align:center;"} `Terminal` (more on that in a minute)
- üì± Mobile computers usually has a lot more "additional" software running alongside the kernel. We call it the <mark>middleware</mark>.
  - These applications support things like: multimedia, graphics, internal app databases.
<!-- ::: -->

## Why bother with this? {.smaller background-color="#F9F9F9"}

::: columns

::: {.column width="70%"}
<!-- ::: {.incremental} -->
- It is improbable you will ever need to interact with the kernel directly.
- But, we often need to install custom software to perform some data analysis
	- This software might not come from Apple or Microsoft Store.
	- Those are things you have to install "manually"

When that happens, you might encounter error messages that make no sense if you don't understand a little of how everything is tied together.

## History {.smaller}

::: columns

::: {.column style="width=60%;"}

<!-- ::: incremental -->
- In the early days of modern computing, back when computers were not accessible to everyone, software (applications) generally came with the <mark>open source code</mark>.
- You could read precisely which instructions the computer would follow when running the software.
- As the industry grew, most software companies released only the <mark>binaries</mark> ‚Äî a type of file you can only execute, not read as if it was a text.
  - This includes Operating Systems! ‚è≠Ô∏è

## UNIX {.smaller}

::: columns

::: {.column style="width=60%;"}

<!-- ::: incremental -->
- UNIX was the first big Operating System, developed at Bell Labs and AT&T
- It aimed to be simple* and easy to port to any hardware architecture
- But it required a license
- In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a group of hackers and activists developed free & open source alternatives to UNIX.

## GNU/Linux {.smaller}

::: columns

::: {.column style="width=60%;"}
<!-- ::: incremental -->
- This led to the birth of one of the most influential operating systems: <mark>GNU/Linux</mark>, or simply Linux.
- ![](/figures/icons/Android_robot.svg){style="height:1em;"} Android, the most popular OS for phones worldwide, is based on Linux.   
- Two people were instrumental to the development of Linux
  - Richard Stallman
  - Linu**s** Torvalds

GNU stands for "GNU is not Unix". Yes, it is recursive.
