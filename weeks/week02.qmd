title: "🗓️ Week 02 - Operating Systems, Files & The Terminal"
date: 1 September 2022
date-meta: 1 September 2022

This week we will look at what happens under the hoods when you give instructions to a computer. 

You will see a brief history of **Operating Systems (OS)**, **filesystems** and the **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** — or the Terminal for those on macOS — and how any of this relates to the data analysis process. We will see why this way of interacting with our computer is the most suitable for developers and how we can interact with it.

We will dedicate a special time to **Linux** and how to interact with Linux machines. This will be particularly important for next week's topic when we learn how to access and navigate computers living in the Cloud.

By the end of the week, you should be able to explore the CLI and perform basic tasks such as reading files, creating directories and calling webpages.
