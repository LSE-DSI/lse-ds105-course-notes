<mark class="idea"></mark> Move "The Cloud" to Week 03 and have "The Terminal" be Week 02 instead.

<mark></mark> Slides from previous year: [DS105/2021MT (Sharepoint)](https://lsecloud.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/TEAM_LSE-LSEDataScienceInitiative-DS105/Shared%20Documents/DS105/MT-2021?csf=1&web=1&e=oMWOCC)

## Lecture (45-50 min)


<mark></mark> This week we provide a preview of one important tool for data scientists: The Cloud. The aims for the week will be to provide a definition for the cloud, to understand that the cloud is made of many components, to start to think about the trade-offs of using the cloud, and to acknowledge that your role as a data scientist is to be aware of the tools without being an expert in all of these.

<mark></mark> By the end of the week you should be able to: (1) Have an idea of what the cloud is. (2) Be able to acknowledge the tradeoffs of using the cloud, (3) Be aware of your role as a data scientist, and (4) have an idea of the different models of cloud services.
