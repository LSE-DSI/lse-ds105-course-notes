We have come to the final week of the Term!

Here's what to expect from this week's lecture (and the week):

- On the first hour of the lecture, Prof. [Ken Benoit](https://kenbenoit.net/) will demonstrate how to implement a data pre-processing pipeline, using his study of Brexit Tweets as a case study. 
    - This will feature: data acquisition, cleaning, tokenisation, and feature selection
    - But he will also show the outputs from topic models, sentiment analysis, and networks of hashtags and topics.
- On the second hour of the lecture, I will show you how to work further with network data. This will include a tutorial of the [igraph](https://igraph.org/) library.

- On Friday, we will hear from you as you present how you are progressing with your projects. 
    - Check 🖋️ [Week 11 presentation - Marking Criteria](/main/assessments.html#week-11-presentation---marking-criteria) for more information on what we expect from you.

Lectures will take a place at **PAR.LG.03**. Join us Tuesday, 6 December 2022 from 4 pm to 6 pm.
