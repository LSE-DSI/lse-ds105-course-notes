| Term          | Definition                                                |
|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Algorithm**          | The set of rules or calculations that are performed by a computer program. Certain algorithms may be more suitable for particular datasets and may have differences in performance (e.g., in speed or accuracy).
| **Central processing<br/> unit (CPU)** | The chip that performs the actual computation on a compute node or VM.
| **Compute node**       | An individual computer that contains a number of CPUs and associated RAM.
| **Core**               | Part of a CPU. Single-core processors contain 1 core per CPU, meaning CPUs and cores are often interchangeable terms.
| **CPU time**           | The time CPUs have spent actually processing data <br/>(often $\operatorname{CPU time} \approx \operatorname{Walltime} \times \operatorname{Number of CPUs}$).
| **Dependency**         | Software that is required by another tool or pipeline for successful execution.
| **Executable**         | The file that contains a tool/program. Some software has a single executable, while others have multiple executables for different commands/steps.
| **High performance<br/> computer (HPC)** | A collection of connected compute nodes.
| **Operating system<br/>(OS)** | The base software that supports a computer's basic functions. Some of the most common linux-based operating systems include those of the Debian distribution (Ubuntu) and those of the RedHat distribution (Fedora and CentOS).
| **Pipeline**           | A pipeline is a workflow consisting of a variety of steps (commands) and/or tools that process a given set of inputs to create the desired output files.
| **Programming<br/> languages** | Specific syntax and rules for instructing a computer to perform specific tasks. Common programming language used in bioinformatics include Bash, Python, Perl, R, C, and C++.
| **Random access <br/>memory (RAM)** | Temporarily stores all the information the CPUs require <br/>(can be accessed by all of the CPUs on the associated node or VM).
| **Scheduler**          | Manages jobs (scripts) running on shared HPC environments. Some common schedulers include SLURM, PBS, Torque, and SGE.
| **Script**             | A file which contains code to be executed in a single programming language.
| **Thread**             | Number of computations that a program can perform concurrently‚Äîdepends on the number of cores (usually 1 core = 1 thread).
| **Tool**               | A software program that performs an analysis on an input dataset to extract meaningful outputs/information‚ÄîTool, software, and program are often used interchangeably but refer to the core components of bioinformatics pipelines.
| **VM**                 | Virtual machine‚ÄîSimilar to a compute node as it behaves as a single computer and contains a desired number of CPUs and associated RAM (usually associated with cloud computing).
| **Walltime**           | The time a program takes to run in our clock-on-the-wall time.
