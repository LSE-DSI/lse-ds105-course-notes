Welcome to Week 08!

See the Python/R code on 👨‍🏫 [Lecture](/weeks/week08/lecture.qmd) page.

In the lecture, I will cover some data transformations you can do with pandas (Python). R users will find that you can do the same things with tidyverse; there will be an R Markdown file for you. 

I will bring solutions to previous questions you asked in previous sessions: how to work with time series, order elements in plots (ordered Categoricals/ordered factors), followed by some medium to advanced-level data transformations you can do with pandas/tidyverse (group-by's, merges and joins), as well as the parallels of all of these data transformations to SQL, the programming language used to query databases. 

**💻 Labs on Friday: Group Presentations**

In the labs on Friday, you are the main event. We are excited to hear about your group projects and what you have managed to explore so far. 

You can structure your presentations however you want, as long as you:

- Share your .ppt or .pdf file on Slack `#week08` before the start of your lab session.
- Address the five main points listed on the [Week 08 presentation - Marking Criteria](/main/assessments.html#week-08-presentation---marking-criteria) page.
