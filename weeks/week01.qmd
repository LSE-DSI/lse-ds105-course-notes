title: "🗓️ Week 1 - Introduction and the Data Science Toolbox"
---

In this first week, we will cover what you can expect to learn from this course and the course logistics: all you need to know about the structure of the lectures, classes, assessments and how we will interact throughout this course. 

We will also cover some of the basics: what do we mean by data science and what tools will you need to use during this course?

We do not have classes this week. Instead, we recommend you use this time to learn or revisit the basics of a programming language (either R or Python).

See sections below for advice on how to do that.
