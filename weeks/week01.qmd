title: "🗓️ Week 1 - Introduction and the Data Science Toolbox"
---

In this first week, we will cover what you can expect to learn from this course and the course logistics: all you need to know about the structure of the lectures, classes, assessments and how we will interact throughout this course. 

We will also cover some of the basics: what do we mean by data science and what tools will you need to use during this course?

Importantly, you will receive an invitation to join our Slack group via e-mail. 

Send an [e-mail to Jon](mailto:J.Cardoso-Silva@lse.ac.uk) if you have not received an invite by the time of the first lecture. 

Slack is a platform used by many companies and institutions where teams can collaborate and communicate about a specific project. 
Most of our "informal" communication and interactions will happen through Slack. There will be channels dedicated to discussing each week's content, a channel for sharing useful links and events, plus a random channel to share random stuff about data science.
