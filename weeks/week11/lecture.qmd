Here's what to expect from this week's lecture (and the week):

- On the first hour of the lecture, Prof. [Ken Benoit](https://kenbenoit.net/) will demonstrate how to implement a data pre-processing pipeline, using his study of Brexit Tweets as a case study. 
    - This will feature: data acquisition, cleaning, tokenisation, and feature selection
    - But he will also show the outputs from topic models, sentiment analysis, and networks of hashtags and topics.
- On the second hour of the lecture, I will show you how to work further with network data. This will include a tutorial of the [igraph](https://igraph.org/) library.
