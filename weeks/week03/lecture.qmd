## ☕ Coffee Break (10 min)

Use this time to chat, stretch, drink some coffee or just relax for a bit by yourself.

## 🖥️ Part II - Demo: Amazon and Google clouds (45-50 min)

Most cloud computing providers allow you to use their services for free, as long as you don't exceed certain pre-established limits on time and amount of CPU, RAM, and other queries per month.

In this demo, I will show you around the [Amazon Web Service (AWS) Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and the [Google Cloud dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard), as we compare their (un-)intuitive user interfaces and how to run an app in the cloud. 

💡 _If you want to replicate the live demo,you  will need to open an account in both cloud providers!_

Things we will explore:

- Accessing the dashboards
- Browsing the catalog of services and documentation available
- Finding the cloud service we want to use
- Creating a virtual machine and accesing it using the command line
- Creating a data storage repository
- Sending data to/from the data storage repository
