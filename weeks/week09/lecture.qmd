## üñ•Ô∏è Part I - Conda environments (45-50 min)

In the first part of the lecture, we will explore [`conda` environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) together (bring your üíªlaptops, and perhaps also coffee!). 

And in the labs, you will practice how to share these environments via Github and also how to use Github more effectively as a team. You will learn about the process of [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for teams.

üí°You will be assessed on knowledge of these best practices as part of your final project. Check the [Project Marking Criteria](/main/assessments.html#projects-marking-criteria): Source Code | Organisation and  Source Code | Collaboration.

## ‚òï Coffee Break (10 min)

Use this time to chat, stretch, drink some coffee or just relax for a bit by yourself.

## üñ•Ô∏è Part II - Tech Support (45-50 min)

Based on what I have been hearing from you, this is what I will cover on the second part of the lecture today:

- **Databases**: what is it? what is SQL? And how to connect to a database directly through pandas. Initially, this content will come on _üóìÔ∏è Week 08_ but we didn't have the time for that.
- **Some Natural Language Processing** (if time allows): a small introduction to [spaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101#annotations-token), a package in Python that handles text as data. 
    - I will focus on tokenization which is the process of breaking sentences into words and counting/describing them (without any `for` loops!)
    - If we don't have time for that, we will return to topic of text data next week and on Week 11 when Prof. [Ken Benoit](https://kenbenoit.net/) will come and deliver a talk about text mining.
