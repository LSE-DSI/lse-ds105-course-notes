## üíª Labs

We do not have classes this week. Instead, we recommend you use this time to learn or revisit the basics of a programming language (either R or Python).

See sections below for advice on how to do that.

## üìí Preparing for the next week

- Join the Slack group of this course [(more info)](/main/communication.qmd)
- Use this time to learn or revisit basic programming skills. Remember: [later in this course](/main/syllabus.qmd), you will start working on a group project that will require some element of coding. You are free to use either R or Python.
