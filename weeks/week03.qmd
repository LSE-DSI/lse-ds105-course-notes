## Lecture (45-50 min)


<mark></mark> This week we will begin exploring Linux and our main way of interacting with Linux machines: the Command-Line Interface (CLI) or for those on MacOS: The Terminal. We will see why this way of interacting with our computer is the most suitable for developers and how we can interact with it. Moreover, we will begin seeing the basic organisation of Linux and go through some basic commands. By the end of the week you should we able to explore the CLI and perform basic tasks such as  reading files, creating directories and calling webpages.
