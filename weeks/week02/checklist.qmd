In our labs this week, we will learn about the command line — also called the terminal. Follow the tips below to get the most out of our session:

- 💻 Bring your laptops. Tablets are not suitable for this class.
    - If you do not love your laptop, you can borrow a laptop from the library.
- 🪟Students who use Windows will have to install additional software on their laptops [^*]. We will dedicate some of our time in the lab to this, but if you want, you could try to follow Steps 1-4 of the Canonical tutorial before coming to class.
- 📝In the lab we will practice the concepts introduced in this week’s lecture. If a concept introduced in the lecture was not clear to you, revisit the slides and bring your questions to the lab. Lecture recordings will be available a couple of days after the day of the lecture.
- 👀Browse the [🔖 Week 02 Appendix page](/weeks/week02/appendix.html):
    - skim through the blog posts and articles therein to reinforce concepts covered in the lecture,
    - bookmark whatever you feel could be relevant to you in the future
