We understand many of you are just learning how to program, so I will add a recap of basic programming concepts to my lecture this week. 

In the first part of the lecture, I will show the basic data types (numbers, strings, vectors, matrices, lists, etc.) and a bit about functions.  Then, on the second part, I will tell you about **data frames** — the ubiquitous data structure that permeates everything in data science regardless of the programming language.

In the <strong>labs</strong>, Anton will help you get data out of APIs and he will show you how data frames can be used to represent the data you received from your requests to an API.
