Keep in mind that after the lecture this week, on Tuesday 25 October 2022, we will release the **Summative Problem Set 02**. This is the second summative assessment of this course and it is worth **15% of your final grade**. You will have until **7 November 2022** — Monday of Week 07 — to submit your solutions via Moodle.
:::

Here is a suggestion of how to plan your week:

- ✍️ **Solve**: If you haven't done so yet, today (24 October 2022) is the last day to submit your first problem set via Moodle. This assessment is worth 10% of your final grade.


- 🧑‍💻 **Keep on practicing Python/R**: take time during the week to practice programming.

    - Ensure you have completed the pre-sessional programming course. You can skip the part about the Git/Github to focus more on getting more fluent with programming, we will introduce you to Git and Github later in this course.

    - If you have completed it, great! Now, try to go over last week's lab roadmap once again by yourself. Take note of the things that don't make much sense to you, and bring these questions to the lecture.

    - Another way to practice is by completing Python challenges on HackerRank, you can start from the Easy ones and progress later.

    - **Whatever you do, just keep on practicing!**

    - If you struggle with any technical questions, ask them on #week05 on Slack or check out the in-person workshops at LSE Digital Skills Lab.

- 🧑‍🏫 **Bring your programming questions to the lecture.**

    - If you want to get the most out of this session, download and install Python and Jupyter Lab in your computer before coming to the lecture. Or, if you are learning R, ensure you have R and the RStudio IDE installed.

    - I will show both Python and R code.


- 📝 **Pitch your ideas of datasets**: we expect all students to pitch their ideas of APIs or web scraping on the `#dataset-ideas-and-team-formation` channel on Slack before attending the lab. 


    - You don't have to commit to anything just yet for your final project, you will have until the first presentation, on Week 08, to show us your initial work with real data.

    - If you haven't seen it, check out the List of suggested APIs we compiled on our website. 

    - Check also the marking criteria for the final project you will have to submit by Lent Term. This might help you get a better idea of what you will need to learn until then.


- 🧑‍💻 **Attend the labs**: you will practice sending API requests and manipulating the responses as a data frame. We will also dedicate some time to help you form teams. Once you form the teams, you will have until W07 to fill out a short team contract document.

- 📟 **Struggling with something?** Share your questions on the `#week05` channel in our Slack.

- 👂**Want to talk to someone else about this course?** Try reaching out to your course representative, `@Amara Otero Salgado` on Slack.
