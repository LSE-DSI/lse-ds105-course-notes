This week, I won't use slides. Instead, I will demonstrate the concepts using Jupyter Notebook. If you want to get the most out of this session, install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install) in your computer before coming to the lecture.


## 🖥️ Part I - Programming recap & data types (45-50 min)

I will take some time to show some the basic data types (numbers, strings, vectors, matrices, lists, etc.) and a bit about functions. And I will reserve time to answer questions you might have about programming.

- Bring your programming-related questions (Python or R).
    - What did you find most difficult to follow during the lab last week?
    - What are the programming concepts you learned about in the pre-sessional courses that you still don't understand? 

## ☕ Coffee Break (10 min)

Use this time to chat, stretch, drink some coffee or just relax for a bit by yourself.

## 🖥️ Part II - Dataframes  (45-50 min)

Come back later to download the Jupyter Notebook I will be using during the lecture.
