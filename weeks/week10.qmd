Here's what to expect from this week's lecture (and the week).

- The first part will be about extracting more useful information from text data. I will be using some `spaCy` tutorials (the equivalent in R is `quanteda`).  
    - The goal is to help you get rid of for loops in your codes as much as possible.
- The second part of the lecture today will be dedicated to support you with your projects. Use this time to work on your projects, I will go around providing help and assistance or helping you find the right tools for what you want to produce.

**Bring your questions and challenges. At this stage of the course, we can adapt to the needs of your projects.**

Lectures will take a place at **PAR.LG.03**. Join us Tuesday, 29 November 2022 from 4 pm to 6 pm.
