This course is assessed by a mix of problem sets, group presentation and a final project. You can find the details below:

## 📝 Problem Sets (25%)

-   A mix of coding tasks and elements of self-assessment, similar to problem sets we solve in the weekly labs
-   Students have until the day before the following class to submit their response to problem sets
-   Summative problem sets will be released on: 
    - **Week 04** - worth 10% of final mark
    - **Week 05** - worth 15% of final mark

## 🗣️ Group Presentation (35%)

-  Students will form groups prior to Reading Week (Week 06)
    - Pitch your ideas of API/datasets on Week 04
    - Form the groups on Week 05
-   Group presentations: 
    - **Week 08** - worth 15% of final mark
    - **Week 11** - worth 20% of final mark

## 🎇 Final Project (40%)

- Each group will have to produce a **webpage** of their project, using Github Markdown
- Description of data, research questions, challenges, statistics and simple plots
- Think of it as a portfolio project!
- Submission deadline: Lent Term
    - Exact date to be confirmed
    - (end of Jan/2023 - beginning of Feb/2023)

### Project's Marking Criteria

While the final project is worth 40% of your final grade, you will be marked on a 0-100 scale.

When you submit your final project, make sure your webpage addresses the questions/requirements below:

| **Source** | **Criteria** | **Description** | **Marks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Webpage | Motivation | Does the webpage explain what made you curious about this kind of data in the first place? | 5 |
| Webpage | Data | Does the webpage tell the story of how you gathered the data (big picture)? Make sure you tell of the challenges you faced. | 5 |
| Webpage | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | What is in the data? What does it look like in general? How big are your datasets? What is the range and distribution of the most relevant variables? |  10 |
| Webpage | Visualisation | Do you have nice plots? Are the labels clear and visible, and are variables clearly identified? Do your plots and tables paint a vivid picture of what the data looks like?  Did you use [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) (R) or [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/) (python) to generate your plots? | 15 |
| Webpage | Storytelling | Find a balance: is your text engaging and clear? Were you able to describe the relevant technical steps of your project without _too many_ details? Did you write a nice conclusion?  | 15  |
|  |  |  |  |
| Source code | Organisation | Is your source code available in a group’s GitHub repository? Is your source code replicable? Did you create a good structure of files and directories? | 10 |
| Source code | Collaboration | Did you list everyone's contribution to the project somewhere in your project's webpage or README file? Did you contribute to your group's Github repository with _at least one commit_? <br/><br/> _Note: we do not expect all group members to do the same thing; each person could have a different contribution. For example, one person could focus more on data collection while another takes care of the visualisations, and the other member could focus more on documentation._  | 10 |
| Source code | Data cleaning | Did you use [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide) (python) or [tidyverse](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) (R) to clean up your data? Do the data types of the variables make sense? Have you taken care of the missing values, deleted them or conducted imputation? Have you ensured the variables' values are consistent and follow the same format? | 15 |
| Source code | Data wrangling | Did you use [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide) and/or [tidyverse](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) to filter, merge, reshape and pivot your data as needed for your analysis? | 15 |
