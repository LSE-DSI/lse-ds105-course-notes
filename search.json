Certain algorithms may be more suitable for particular datasets and may have differences in performance (e.g., in speed or accuracy).\n\n\nCentral processing unit (CPU)\nThe chip that performs the actual computation on a compute node or VM.\n\n\nCompute node\nAn individual computer that contains a number of CPUs and associated RAM.\n\n\nCore\nPart of a CPU. Single-core processors contain 1 core per CPU, meaning CPUs and cores are often interchangeable terms.\n\n\nCPU time\nThe time CPUs have spent actually processing data (often \\(\\operatorname{CPU time} \\approx \\operatorname{Walltime} \\times \\operatorname{Number of CPUs}\\)).\n\n\nDependency\nSoftware that is required by another tool or pipeline for successful execution.\n\n\nExecutable\nThe file that contains a tool/program. Some software has a single executable, while others have multiple executables for different commands/steps.\n\n\nHigh performance computer (HPC)\nA collection of connected compute nodes.\n\n\nOperating system(OS)\nThe base software that supports a computer’s basic functions. Some of the most common linux-based operating systems include those of the Debian distribution (Ubuntu) and those of the RedHat distribution (Fedora and CentOS).\n\n\nPipeline\nA pipeline is a workflow consisting of a variety of steps (commands) and/or tools that process a given set of inputs to create the desired output files.\n\n\nProgramming languages\nSpecific syntax and rules for instructing a computer to perform specific tasks. Common programming language used in bioinformatics include Bash, Python, Perl, R, C, and C++.\n\n\nRandom access memory (RAM)\nTemporarily stores all the information the CPUs require (can be accessed by all of the CPUs on the associated node or VM).\n\n\nScheduler\nManages jobs (scripts) running on shared HPC environments. Some common schedulers include SLURM, PBS, Torque, and SGE.\n\n\nScript\nA file which contains code to be executed in a single programming language.\n\n\nThread\nNumber of computations that a program can perform concurrently—depends on the number of cores (usually 1 core = 1 thread).\n\n\nTool\nA software program that performs an analysis on an input dataset to extract meaningful outputs/information—Tool, software, and program are often used interchangeably but refer to the core components of bioinformatics pipelines.\n\n\nVM\nVirtual machine—Similar to a compute node as it behaves as a single computer and contains a desired number of CPUs and associated RAM (usually associated with cloud computing).\n\n\nWalltime\nThe time a program takes to run in our clock-on-the-wall time."
