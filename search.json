Certain algorithms may be more suitable for particular datasets and may have differences in performance (e.g., in speed or accuracy).\n\n\nCentral processing unit (CPU)\nThe chip that performs the actual computation on a compute node or VM.\n\n\nCompute node\nAn individual computer that contains a number of CPUs and associated RAM.\n\n\nCore\nPart of a CPU. Single-core processors contain 1 core per CPU, meaning CPUs and cores are often interchangeable terms.\n\n\nCPU time\nThe time CPUs have spent actually processing data (often \\(\\operatorname{CPU time} \\approx \\operatorname{Walltime} \\times \\operatorname{Number of CPUs}\\)).\n\n\nDependency\nSoftware that is required by another tool or pipeline for successful execution.\n\n\nExecutable\nThe file that contains a tool/program. Some software has a single executable, while others have multiple executables for different commands/steps.\n\n\nHigh performance computer (HPC)\nA collection of connected compute nodes.\n\n\nOperating system(OS)\nThe base software that supports a computer’s basic functions. Some of the most common linux-based operating systems include those of the Debian distribution (Ubuntu) and those of the RedHat distribution (Fedora and CentOS).\n\n\nPipeline\nA pipeline is a workflow consisting of a variety of steps (commands) and/or tools that process a given set of inputs to create the desired output files.\n\n\nProgramming languages\nSpecific syntax and rules for instructing a computer to perform specific tasks. Common programming language used in bioinformatics include Bash, Python, Perl, R, C, and C++.\n\n\nRandom access memory (RAM)\nTemporarily stores all the information the CPUs require (can be accessed by all of the CPUs on the associated node or VM).\n\n\nScheduler\nManages jobs (scripts) running on shared HPC environments. Some common schedulers include SLURM, PBS, Torque, and SGE.\n\n\nScript\nA file which contains code to be executed in a single programming language.\n\n\nThread\nNumber of computations that a program can perform concurrently—depends on the number of cores (usually 1 core = 1 thread).\n\n\nTool\nA software program that performs an analysis on an input dataset to extract meaningful outputs/information—Tool, software, and program are often used interchangeably but refer to the core components of bioinformatics pipelines.\n\n\nVM\nVirtual machine—Similar to a compute node as it behaves as a single computer and contains a desired number of CPUs and associated RAM (usually associated with cloud computing).\n\n\nWalltime\nThe time a program takes to run in our clock-on-the-wall time."

There are differences between UNIX systems and others in the way they work with SSH. Choose the OS you are using and follow the steps to connect to the cloud.\n\n\n Windows users\n\n\n\nThere are various SSH clients that you can use for Windows. Here we explore the one called PuTTY. You will need to follow the steps below to establish an SSH connection.\n🎯 ACTION POINTS\n\nGo to this website and download the installation file.\nInstall PuTTY using the installation file.\nLaunch PuTTY.\nNavigate to the Host Name (or IP address) box and enter the host address of our machine which is ec2-18-130-96-20.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\nClick Open.\nIf you see a secrutiy alert pop up, simply click Accept.\nEnter your username and your password (which is at this point your username).\nThe first time you login, you need to give a new password for your account. Type your current password and then make a new password as instructed. Note that it may fail to update the password because the password is too simple. Try to make more complex pattern in this case. It is recommended to have at least 8 characters with the combination of letters and numbers.\n\nOnce the password is updated, the connection will be closed and you need to reopen a connection using PuTTY. If your conection has been successfull, you will see the following screen.\nINSERT IMAGE OF THE SCREEN\nViola! Now you are connected to the cloud!\n\nIf you wish to close your connection to the cloud simply write exit and hit enter.\n\n\n\n\n macOS, Linux or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) users\n\n\n\nLuckily for macOS and Linux users the connection to the SSH is much simpler. You will see that following the steps below.\n🎯 ACTION POINTS\n\nOpen the terminal.\nType the following command after replacing <username> with your actual username.\n$ ssh <username>@ec2-18-130-96-20.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\nEnter your password (which is at this point your username).\nThe first time you login, you need to give a new password for your account.

Using this channel we can not only send commands but also send and recieve files. In order to do that we will use the scp command that stands for “secure copy”. Follow the steps below to save the secrets files you created above to your computer.\nGenerally the scp commands work in the following way:\n$ scp location_1/file location_2/file\nIt means that we are copying a file from location_1 to location_2. Let’s see how it’s done with the cloud.\n🎯 ACTION POINTS\n\nExit the cloud machine using the following code:\n\n   $ exit \n\nTo copy the secret_name.txt file from your cloud machine use the following command. Make sure you have replaced all the <username>s with your actual username.\n$ scp <username>@ec2-18-130-96-20.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/<username>/<username>_files/secret_name.txt .\n❗ Important\nWe would encourage you to pay attention to several things here:\n\nThere is a period symbol at the end of the code. This period stands for you currentl location on your local machine. You remember that the scp command takes two locations - the one we copy the file from and the one we copy the file to. A period here basically says “Copy it right here”.\nYou can see that the actual path to the file on your virtual machine is specified after the hostname followed by a colon. First we specify the username, then the hostname and then the path inside of the machine.\n\nMake sure the file is copied to the chosen directory.\nBut what if we wanted to copy all the files from the folder or the folder itself? For that we can avoid specifying the whole path to a concrete file and simply replace the name of the file with an asterisk:\n$ scp <username>@ec2-18-130-96-20.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/<username>/<username>_files/* .\nThis way we copy all the files from the <username>_files folder.\nShould you wish to copy the folder itself, use the path to the folder. You will also add the -r (for recursive) option in the code as shown below.\n$ scp -r <username>@ec2-18-130-96-20.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/<username>/<username>_files .\nMake sure both commands worked for you."

A cloud can help here by executing it for you without taking the resources of your computer.\nLet’s do it, but before that we will learn how to do a very interesting trick.\n🎯 ACTION POINTS\n\nOpen a new bash shell window on your local machine.\nNavigate to a directory of your choice or create one.\nCreate a new file called waiting.py and include the following code inside:\nimport time\ntime.sleep(10)\n\nprint('The waiting is complete.')\nThis file launches a script that waits for 10 seconds and then prints ‘The waiting is complete.’. You might think that it doesn’t make sense. However, let us show you something…\nRun this Python script in the following way:\npython waiting.py\nWhat did it do? Hopefully, exactly what was expected. It waited for 10 seconds and then printed one sentence. You might have noticed that you could not execute commands while it was running. But what if we could!\nTry running the following code:\npython waiting.py &\nDo you see the difference? Can you now run whoami or ls while we wait for the code to run?\n\nWell done!
