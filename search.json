What is the range and distribution of the most relevant variables?\n10\n\n\nWebpage\nVisualisation\nDo you have nice plots? Are the labels clear and visible, and are variables clearly identified? Do your plots and tables paint a vivid picture of what the data looks like? Did you use ggplot (R) or plotnine (python) to generate your plots?\n15\n\n\nWebpage\nStorytelling\nFind a balance: is your text engaging and clear?

Did you create a good structure of files and directories?\n10\n\n\nSource code\nCollaboration\nDid you list everyone’s contribution to the project somewhere in your project’s webpage or README file? Did you contribute to your group’s Github repository with at least one commit?  Note: we do not expect all group members to do the same thing; each person could have a different contribution. For example, one person could focus more on data collection while another takes care of the visualisations, and the other member could focus more on documentation.\n10\n\n\nSource code\nData cleaning\nDid you use pandas (python) or tidyverse (R) to clean up your data? Do the data types of the variables make sense? Have you taken care of the missing values, deleted them or conducted imputation? Have you ensured the variables’ values are consistent and follow the same format?\n15\n\n\nSource code\nData wrangling\nDid you use pandas and/or tidyverse to filter, merge, reshape and pivot your data as needed for your analysis?\n15"

Certain algorithms may be more suitable for particular datasets and may have differences in performance (e.g., in speed or accuracy).\n\n\nCentral processing unit (CPU)\nThe chip that performs the actual computation on a compute node or VM.\n\n\nCompute node\nAn individual computer that contains a number of CPUs and associated RAM.\n\n\nCore\nPart of a CPU. Single-core processors contain 1 core per CPU, meaning CPUs and cores are often interchangeable terms.\n\n\nCPU time\nThe time CPUs have spent actually processing data (often \\(\\operatorname{CPU time} \\approx \\operatorname{Walltime} \\times \\operatorname{Number of CPUs}\\)).\n\n\nDependency\nSoftware that is required by another tool or pipeline for successful execution.\n\n\nExecutable\nThe file that contains a tool/program. Some software has a single executable, while others have multiple executables for different commands/steps.\n\n\nHigh performance computer (HPC)\nA collection of connected compute nodes.\n\n\nOperating system(OS)\nThe base software that supports a computer’s basic functions. Some of the most common linux-based operating systems include those of the Debian distribution (Ubuntu) and those of the RedHat distribution (Fedora and CentOS).\n\n\nPipeline\nA pipeline is a workflow consisting of a variety of steps (commands) and/or tools that process a given set of inputs to create the desired output files.\n\n\nProgramming languages\nSpecific syntax and rules for instructing a computer to perform specific tasks. Common programming language used in bioinformatics include Bash, Python, Perl, R, C, and C++.\n\n\nRandom access memory (RAM)\nTemporarily stores all the information the CPUs require (can be accessed by all of the CPUs on the associated node or VM).\n\n\nScheduler\nManages jobs (scripts) running on shared HPC environments. Some common schedulers include SLURM, PBS, Torque, and SGE.\n\n\nScript\nA file which contains code to be executed in a single programming language.\n\n\nThread\nNumber of computations that a program can perform concurrently—depends on the number of cores (usually 1 core = 1 thread).\n\n\nTool\nA software program that performs an analysis on an input dataset to extract meaningful outputs/information—Tool, software, and program are often used interchangeably but refer to the core components of bioinformatics pipelines.\n\n\nVM\nVirtual machine—Similar to a compute node as it behaves as a single computer and contains a desired number of CPUs and associated RAM (usually associated with cloud computing).\n\n\nWalltime\nThe time a program takes to run in our clock-on-the-wall time."

Let’s use it to download the text editor vim.\n🎯 ACTION POINTS\n\nWhenever you want to download software with apt, you have to ensure you have the most up-to-date information from the central “store”. You can do this via the following command:\n sudo apt update\nThis command requires you to have admin rights (as root), which is why we run it with sudo 4. You might be asked to type your password.\nInstall vim:\n sudo apt install vim\nNow you can open vim:\n vim\nTo quit, press Esc, then type :q and hit ENTER. Still stuck and cannot quit vim? You are not alone.\n\n\n\n MacOS users\n\n\n\n🎯 ACTION POINTS\nYou can use ‘Homebrew’ to install software in a very similar way to apt command in a Linux system.\n\nFirst, you need to be sure if homebrew is installed on your system. You can check it with the terminal.\nbrew\n\n\nIf you receive an error:\nzsh: command not found: brew\nYou should install Homebrew in your system. You can do this with the following command:\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\nif you have not installed XCode before, the installation script will ask you to install it as well, please accept to continue.\n\n\nYou can install vim now:\nbrew install vim\nYou can open vim:\nvim\n\n\nYou can update brew with the command:\nbrew update"

Once there, you will be able to explore and practice the Bash shell commands in that remote machine.\nAlternatively, if you feel like it, you could take some time this week to learn more about the Windows PowerShell. We added a new section to last week’s appendix 🔖 Week 02 Appendix called “Do you want to master Windows PowerShell instead?” pointing to some useful tutorials. Although the commands will vary, the experience of using this shell will not be too different than using the bash shell we are adopting in this course, it will not be a waste of your time.\nYou will be able to access the cloud on our Friday labs even if WSL2 didn’t work in your machine.\n\n\nNow, as for what to expect from this week:\n\n🗳️ Why not nominate yourself to act as the course representative? Nominations should be made via Slack (channel #student-rep) until this Monday 10 October 2022 12 p.m.. If no one nominates themselves, well… we won’t have any students representing DS105 this term. Read more about the student representative role here.\n✍️ You have until Thursday 13 October 2022 to submit the W02/W03 formative assignment (not graded). Submit your solutions via Moodle.\n👀 The 🔖 Week 02 Appendix page is still relevant for this week. In particular, I suggest you practice editing files using the terminal (Text Editors section) during the week.\n📟 Questions about the terminal? Got any questions of the form “how could I do X in the terminal?”? Have you been exploring the terminal yourself and found something interesting? Need any technical support? Share those on #week03 of our Slack group. I (Jon) often respond questions there within a day.\n💻 Bring your laptops to the labs. Remember: you can borrow a laptop from the library.\n\nBring your laptop to the lecture too if you want to setup your own cloud service and replicate what I will be demonstrating.\n\n📝 Keep in mind that next week you will have to submit your first summative assignment.\n\nOn Friday, we will post the W03/W04 summative assignment (worth 10% of final marks) on Moodle.\nYou will have until 20 October 2022 to submit it. The format will be similar to the current formative assignment, but this time it will involve running commands in the remote virtual machine.\nThe best way to prepare for this is to practice using the terminal by yourself. Once again, 🔖 Week 02 Appendix might be useful to you."

A period here basically says “Copy it right here”.\nYou can see that the actual path to the file on your virtual machine is specified after the hostname followed by a colon. First, we specify the username, then the hostname and then the path inside of the machine.\n\nMake sure the file is copied to the chosen directory.\nBut what if we wanted to copy all the files from the folder or the folder itself? For that we can avoid specifying the whole path to a concrete file and simply replace the name of the file with an asterisk:\n scp <username>@ec2-18-170-39-14.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/<username>/<username>_files/* .\nThis way we copy all the files from the <username>_files folder.\nShould you wish to copy the folder itself, use the path to the folder.

It is when you will start putting your knowledge of programming to use.\n\nReserve some time before the labs on Friday to replicate the web scraping and API demos I showed in the lecture. Or even better, reuse it to gather and collect data from other websites of your interest.\nI will focus the demo on Python but we will show you how to adapt the same things to R.\n\n✍️ Solve: The First Summative Problem Set will be released on 18 October 2022 on Moodle. Reserve some time during the week to solve it before the lab on Friday.\n🧑‍💻 Attend the labs: If you have practiced with the code I introduced in the lecture, the labs will be much easier. Bring your technical questions with you!\n📝 Topics of interest: Do you already have an idea of which websites you want to scrape, or which public APIs you want to use? Use the ‘#dataset-ideas-and-team-formation’ channel on Slack\n\nAt the end of the week, I will add a page to our website that will include a 📜 list of suggested APIs and websites suitable for web scraping. This will only be suggestions; when you form your teams you can choose to use other websites/APIs, as long as it meets the required criteria of the final project.\nThis page will also explain what will be expected of you in the final project: the minimum volume of data you will need to obtain, what will be required in terms of data pre-processing (W05 and beyond), visualisations, the code you will need to provide, etc."

This assessment is worth 10% of your final grade.\n🧑‍💻 Keep on practicing Python/R: take time during the week to practice programming.\n\nEnsure you have completed the pre-sessional programming course. You can skip the part about the Git/Github to focus more on getting more fluent with programming, we will introduce you to Git and Github later in this course.\nIf you have completed it, great! Now, try to go over last week’s lab roadmap once again by yourself. Take note of the things that don’t make much sense to you, and bring these questions to the lecture.\nAnother way to practice is by completing Python challenges on HackerRank, you can start from the Easy ones and progress later.\nWhatever you do, just keep on practicing!\nIf you struggle with any technical questions, ask them on #week05 on Slack or check out the in-person workshops at LSE Digital Skills Lab.\n\n🧑‍🏫 Bring your programming questions to the lecture.\n\nIf you want to get the most out of this session, download and install Python and Jupyter Lab in your computer before coming to the lecture. Or, if you are learning R, ensure you have R and the RStudio IDE installed.\nI will show both Python and R code.\n\n📝 Pitch your ideas of datasets: we expect all students to pitch their ideas of APIs or web scraping on the #dataset-ideas-and-team-formation channel on Slack before attending the lab.\n\nYou don’t have to commit to anything just yet for your final project, you will have until the first presentation, on Week 08, to show us your initial work with real data.\nIf you haven’t seen it, check out the List of suggested APIs we compiled on our website.\nCheck also the marking criteria for the final project you will have to submit by Lent Term. This might help you get a better idea of what you will need to learn until then.\n\n🧑‍💻 Attend the labs: you will practice sending API requests and manipulating the responses as a data frame. We will also dedicate some time to help you form teams. Once you form the teams, you will have until W07 to fill out a short team contract document.\n📟 Struggling with something? Share your questions on the #week05 channel in our Slack.\n👂Want to talk to someone else about this course? Try reaching out to your course representative, @Amara Otero Salgado on Slack."
